This repositiry contains my student's homeworks for training "Getting Started with Data Engineering" (de-101)  that I am currently taking.  
The main page of the course is here - [Data Learn](https://github.com/Data-Learn)  
My goal is to systematize and develop my data engineering skiils gained over 2 years of working as a data scientist.  
I will add my work on modules as they progress.  
Below there are the links to completed homeworks and a brief description of the results.
